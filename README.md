## WEB SCRAPPING 
<p>
I completed a web scraping project where I scraped data from the Flipkart website using the Selector Gadget extension. I gathered information like TV names, ratings, prices, reviews, and offers using BeautifulSoup for parsing and requests for making HTTP requests. The scraped data was organized into a Pandas DataFrame, where I handled missing values with a constant value using `SimpleImputer` from `sklearn`. Additionally, I used `OrdinalEncoder` to convert categorical data, such as ratings, into numeric values, preparing the data for machine learning. Finally, the cleaned dataset was exported to Excel for further analysis.
